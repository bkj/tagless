### tagless/docker

Run tagless (elasticsearch version) in a Docker container

#### Usage

Look at `run.sh` -- should be reasonably straightforward

#### Todo

Wrap the active search version in Docker container
    !! This probably should be done when I add multi-class support
    to the active search version
